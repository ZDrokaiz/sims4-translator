# 🧩 The Sims 4 Translator - Modified by ZDrokaiz

Hi! I'm ZDrokaiz.

I'm not a very active member of The Sims 4 community, but I wanted to contribute at least a little. I’ve modified version 1.3.1 of **The Sims 4 Translator**, which had some serious bugs as of July 2025.

I added support for the **MyMemory** translation service alongside Google Translate, to improve translation quality and provide users with an alternative option.

If you’ve had issues with the official version, I believe this one should fix them. This will probably be the **first and only version** I release — unless it breaks again... in that case, I might show up once more 😅.

This tool has been very useful for me. Even though I’ve never posted anything before, I’ve done plenty of translations using version 1.2.2.
